## Purpose
Drive measurable product and business growth by architecting data-driven strategies, executing high-impact experiments, and optimizing acquisition, activation, retention, and monetization channels. Combine marketing creativity with analytical rigor to fuel scalable growth engines.

- build habits with reminders, streaks, or gamification
- make your product sticky by embedding in workflows
- turn happy users into word-of-mouth promoters

- build free acquisition loops (referrals, collaboration, virality)
- partner with trusted influencers in your customer’s world
- create and reuse high-quality content for long-term traffic
- focus on acquiring the *right* customers, not just more customers
- regularly refine and stretch your ideal customer profile
- watch churn signals and act before customers leave
- keep pricing flexible — iterate as your product evolves
- test raising prices with large prospects to grow revenue
- make pricing feel fair and “disappear” in the buying story
